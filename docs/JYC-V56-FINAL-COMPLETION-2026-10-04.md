# JYC V56 FINAL COMPLETION PASS — 2026-10-04

## Scope
Final pass against the supplied JYC Website development specification, senior/V1 product contract, supplied hub material and committed source-media archive.

## Design contract
- Light surface remains JYC cream/beige: #f5f1e6.
- Dark surface remains near-black.
- Primary text remains ink/near-black in light mode and warm white in dark mode.
- Red is reserved for attention; gold is secondary.
- No random blue/purple gradients.
- Public navigation remains top navigation; mobile uses logo + hamburger.
- Public composition is centered and editorial.
- Copy is explicitly allowed to wrap; public card/detail text is not line-clamped.
- Interactive targets retain accessibility sizing and visible focus treatment.
- Reduced-motion behavior is preserved.

Source: supplied JYC Website specification.

## Photo architecture
The public experience now uses real supplied JYC media as a first-class content layer:
- hub identity cards use source photography where available;
- club detail pages expose source-photo strips;
- event visuals prefer source event media;
- homepage photo wall and photo story use maintained source imagery;
- Gallery separates photography, artwork/design and other source visuals;
- Gallery supports role, year, collection and album filtering;
- lightbox supports keyboard navigation, focus restoration and previous/next;
- provenance/source labels are retained;
- 92 source-photo records exist in Supabase as review-stage rows and are intentionally not auto-published.
Unreviewed source material is not silently presented as current official content.

## Hub identity coverage
- 23 maintained community identities.
- 17 entries are labelled brochure-verified from the 2026 JIIT admission brochure.
- 6 additional entries are labelled source-material.
- Qriosity and JIIT OPTICA are covered by content and identity layers.
- Automated QA now rejects stale verified-current registry states.

## QA
Latest GitHub commit: b2152b47a09c1bdacd459f4c63184ed557f96bff.
Latest Quality Gate: passed.
Latest CodeQL: passed.
Latest CI: dependency vulnerability gate, npm QA, SEO QA, production build and browser QA all passed; only GitHub post-job cleanup was still completing at the time of this audit.
Browser QA: all 23 checks passed, including 320px mobile overflow/text visibility, light/dark contrast, reduced motion, route safety and photo-led page rendering.

## Supabase
Production project: ogbanmjokjlxfuktkicj.
Current gallery state:
- 92 gallery rows
- 92 photography rows
- 92 pending/review-stage rows
- 0 auto-published source-photo rows
Security advisor remaining findings are intentional/internal RLS tables, intentionally public/read or registration SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, authenticated admin helper RPCs, and Supabase Auth leaked-password protection. The latter requires the Supabase Auth Dashboard setting and is not exposed by the available database tooling.

## External deployment boundary
The available Vercel connector is not authorized for the JYC project scope, so production deployment/URL verification cannot be honestly certified from this session.

## Final assessment
Code-side design, content architecture, source-media architecture, Supabase media metadata, hub identity consistency and automated QA are complete for this pass. Remaining work is limited to external account configuration/review gates rather than another speculative UI rewrite.
