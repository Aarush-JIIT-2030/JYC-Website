# JYC V56 — Photo Pool Expansion

Date: 2026-10-04

## What changed

- Photo Story now consumes the full source-photo pool across the maintained hub registry, interleaved round-robin by community before deduplication.
- Photo Story has no artificial frame-count ceiling; every unique published gallery/source photo can enter the rotating queue.
- Photo Chapters now consume the full photo set for every hub and every family chapter.
- The Photo Story thumbnail rail is horizontally scrollable so a larger pool does not squeeze the layout.
- The progress indicator pauses while the story is hovered.
- The autoplay control remains keyboard-focusable and reduced-motion behavior remains intact.

## Media availability check

The uploaded JYC-Website-V20.3.0-SIGNATURE-ADMIN-FINAL(1).zip contains only four image files, all branding/phoenix assets. It does not contain the five master photo archives previously referenced by the project.

The current repository already contains the curated 171-image public asset set. The implementation therefore expands the transition feature over the existing source-backed pool rather than inventing or substituting unrelated images.

## Master archive extraction

When all-extracted-images-part1.zip through all-extracted-images-part5.zip are available, run:

node scripts/inventory-image-archives.mjs <part1.zip> <part2.zip> <part3.zip> <part4.zip> <part5.zip>

Use the resulting duplicate/basename report to add only genuinely new source images, then map them through jyc-source-media.js so every image has provenance and alt text.

## Design rule

Do not make every card auto-rotate. Automatic motion is reserved for the editorial Photo Story; the rest of the archive remains user-controlled. This keeps the senior-requested JYC visual language quiet, professional and readable.
