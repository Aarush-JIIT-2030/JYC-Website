# JYC V54 — Production Completion Audit — 2026-10-04

## Completed in this pass

- Connected production Supabase project is active.
- Applied production hardening, AI/rate-limit hardening, campus verification, media write boundary, publication verification, verification identity audit, public-submission protection, function ACL hardening and FK indexes.
- Deployed seven Edge Functions: admin-management, send-notification, backup-site-data, ai-content-assist, error-report, media-upload and public-submission.
- Added/fixed the contact/project submission schema.
- Repaired the public-submission migration delimiter bug.
- Repaired the JSON publication trigger variable/column collision and pinned its SECURITY DEFINER search path.
- Added a verified production content seed: 17 JIIT 128 clubs from the official 2026 JIIT admission brochure, JAI 2026 and Converge 2026 event records, and six curated gallery records.
- Added repository migrations matching the production database changes.
- Current production content snapshot: 17 clubs, 2 events, 6 gallery records; 19 verification records.
- Storage buckets: private JSON backups and public image media with constrained MIME types/size.
- GitHub CI and CodeQL are triggered from the current main branch; the latest CI run was still pending at audit time.

## Current security-advisor interpretation

Remaining warnings are mostly intentional architecture or dashboard configuration:

- SECURITY DEFINER jyc_read_site_data is intentionally callable by public users because the public table itself is admin-RLS protected; the function filters unpublished/admin-only fields before returning public content.
- jyc_register_for_event is intentionally public because it is the native registration RPC and has its own validation/rate-limit path.
- is_* and jyc_v2_* helpers are SECURITY DEFINER helpers used by RLS; their authenticated execution is required by the current policy design.
- Four rate-limit tables have RLS without direct policies; they are intentionally inaccessible to client roles and used through trusted functions.
- Supabase still reports leaked-password protection disabled; this must be enabled in Auth settings.
- Performance advisor still reports auth.uid()/current_setting() init-plan warnings and duplicate permissive policies. These are optimization/cleanup work, not immediate correctness blockers.

## Remaining production gates

1. Configure custom Edge Function secrets: SITE_ORIGINS / SITE_ORIGIN; VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_SUBJECT; BACKUP_FUNCTION_TOKEN; OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_MODEL.
2. Enable Supabase leaked-password protection.
3. Confirm Auth URL/redirect configuration, email confirmation and production SMTP.
4. Verify the real Vercel project is connected to coolbandariya/JYC-Website; the currently connected Vercel account exposes no JYC project, so production deployment cannot yet be certified from this connection.
5. Run real browser QA against the production URL at 320/360/390/430px and desktop widths, including deep links, admin login, role boundaries, gallery lightbox/upload, event registration, contact/project submission and theme/reduced-motion behavior.
6. Complete full supplied-photo ingestion: classify all source photos, remove duplicates, verify provenance, populate album/club/event relationships, generate responsive variants and audit broken/external URLs.
7. Verify the remaining 2026–27 hub ecosystem beyond the brochure-backed 17. Current JIIT public material describes a broader 30+ active-hub ecosystem; the website should not imply the 17-record verified set is exhaustive.
8. Add current leadership/team records only after source verification for the current 2026–27 tenure.
9. Migrate Edge Functions away from legacy SUPABASE_ANON_KEY / SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY to the current publishable/secret-key model before the legacy-key transition becomes a deployment concern.
10. Optimize the remaining RLS init-plan warnings and consolidate duplicate permissive policies after behavior-preserving tests.
11. Run Lighthouse/WebPageTest-style performance checks on the actual production build, especially hero/LCP and gallery images.
12. Keep GitHub, Supabase migration history and Vercel deployment on the same release SHA and record the final production URL.

## Scope deliberately not expanded

Do not add academic portal, attendance, passes/certificates, campus utility dashboard, social likes/DMs, public chatbot, or decorative WebGL until the production content/backend/release gates above are complete.
